> This monorepo serves as a tool for learning as well as reference point for a couple of different things:
> - A React folder structure that will scale with your application
> - How to build your own reusable components that can be shared across your application
> - How to make use of environmental variables
> - How to implement various approaches to state management (Redux, react-query, Recoil etc)
> - How to persist state to local storage so that it's available on the user's next visit

* [redux-clean](https://github.com/askharley/react-recoil-workshop/tree/main/final-redux) - a demonstration on how using libraries like [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions) and [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) can allow us to write cleaner and simpler Redux code without the boilerplate and pains that come with immutability
